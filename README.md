My journey into coding and cybersecurity began with a fascination for coding at the age of 11. I started learning Python and quickly mastered its fundamentals. However, my interest shifted towards cybersecurity when I was 14 years old. I pursued an apprenticeship and further education in the field. During this time, I honed my skills in areas such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. My dedication to cybersecurity continued to grow as I delved deeper into the field, constantly pushing myself to learn and adapt to new challenges.
