<summary> 👨‍💻 My Journey</summary>
My coding journey began at the age of 12 with Python. Even at a young age, I quickly learned the fundamentals and became skilled in the language. With each line of code I wrote, my abilities improved, and my passion for programming grew stronger.
As I gained more confidence in Python, I craved new challenges. At 13, I explored other languages like C++, eager to discover their unique capabilities. Through self-study, online resources, and hands-on experimentation, my understanding of C++ grew steadily.
I found YouTube to be an invaluable learning tool. Countless tutorials and educational videos fueled my curiosity and helped me refine my programming skills. I also dedicated numerous hours to testing my abilities, pushing myself to solve complex problems and make my code more efficient.
